Comments:
Before we dive into Object Oriented Programming, let's revisit JavaScript objects.
Give your motorBike object a wheels, engines and seats attribute and set them to numbers.

Tests:
motorBike should have a engines attribute set to a number.
motorBike should have a wheels attribute set to a number.
motorBike should have a seats attribute set to a number.

var car = {
  "wheels":4,

};

var motorBike = {

  // Only change code below this line.
  "engines":1,
  "wheels":2,
  "seats":2
};
